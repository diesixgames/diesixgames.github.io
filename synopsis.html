skirmish game.
You are commanding a looting crew of 3-5 characters to enter a
multi-entranced dungeon to claim its loot. Depends on playstyles that the
crew could be divided into multiple factions.</p>
<p>The game is best played with a party of 4 to 8, with the use of winner and
loser brackets. For every winning round, a gameplay-affecting loot is
rewarded to the winner. The player may use it for their next round or save
them to use all together at the end.</p>
